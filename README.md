### **Reflections and Comments:**

 - How did this go, overall?
  
   There is some difficulty in managing the course of affairs, 
   but with the follow-up of the steps and instructions of the teacher, 
   things went well.

- What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?
 
  So far, all questions have been answered.

- How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started,
 how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
 
  It tooks about 3 hours, i thinked it will take 1:30.

### Project Name: ABOUT-ME 

  I added two more questions to the previous questions from Lab02, and these questions were executed using for Loop, andwhile loop, the first question; offers the user to guess the correct number and has four attempts to answer. 
  As for the second question; several correct options have been included and the user must choose one of these three correct options. I also modified the web content by adding ordered and unordered lists
